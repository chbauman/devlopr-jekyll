# Personal website

Forked from: https://github.com/sujaykundu777/devlopr-jekyll.
Many features were removed for simplicity.

## Local testing

To test the website locally, use:

```
$ ruby -v
$ gem install jekyll bundler
$ bundler -v
$ bundle update
$ bundle exec jekyll -v
$ bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```
